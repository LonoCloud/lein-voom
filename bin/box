## ATTENTION ##
# This script is designed to be invoked via an alias:
#
#    $ alias box="source /path/to/box/script"
#
# Invoking in this manner allows us to change the caller's current
# directory and environment. Very handy things... however this means
# we need to be careful with the callers environment. We need to be
# sure that if we change directory or set environment variables that
# we don't clobber caller state in unintended ways. Be sure therefore
# to restore the current working directory (unless intending to
# actually change it and be sure to use the "local" qualifier on
# variable declarations in funtions.

# For the above reasons, we can use set -x no matter how much we would
# like to. (It will call the calling context to exit.)
